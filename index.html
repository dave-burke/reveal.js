							<li>What you have to say is important.</li>
							<li>If you're here today, whether you're a member or you're just considering becoming a member, it's because you know you have something to say.</li>
							<li>For some of you there's somthing standing in the way</li>
							<li>For some people it's nerves, and I can tell you than in my 13 years in Toastmasters I have seen dozens of people say goodbye to the quiver that was in their voice when they started.</li>
							<li>But today I want to talk about another obstacle that seems to come up just as often: time.</li>
							<li>Everyone's so busy. Too busy to work on Toastmasters, they say.</li>
							<li>So today I want to share some tips that I use to get my speeches done when I'm really busy.</li>
							<li>And I'm not even going to use Chat-GPT!</li>

						<img alt="A lot of people at TED expressed shock that I'd been able to give a TED talk on less than 4 days' notice.  It's actually worse; due to prior commitments and schedule mishaps, I only wrote my talk the day before. Which I trusted myself to do, and to commit to TED to doing, because I knew this Secret of Writing:  &quot;There is no such thing as writer's block, only holding yourself to too high a standard.&quot; I knew I could definitely write six minutes of text, even if it might not be as good as I wanted.  When time got short, I lowered my ambitions and kept going. But man, I would not have wanted to try that fifteen years earlier." src="images/yudkowsky_tweet.png"/>

								<li>It's true that you'll get out of Toastmasters what you put into it. If you put in more time, you'll get more experience.</li>
								<li>But if you can't put in as much time as you'd like, don't let that paralyze you.</li>
								<li>You will always learn more from doing something rather than nothing.</li>
								<li>"Lose your first 50 games as quickly as possible."</li>
								<li>The best way to improve at speaking is to give your first 50 bad speeches as fast as possible.</li>

					<h2>Write your speech backwards</h2>
					<aside class="notes">
						<ul>
							<li>Start with a call to action -- what is <em>one thing</em> you want your audience to do or know?</li>
							<li>Write down three supporting points</li>
							<li>You have your speech outline.</li>
							<li>worst case: you could give your speech now</li>
							<li>It's better to prepare more details, but you don't <em>have</em> to</li>

					<h2>Use notes if you have to</h2>
					<aside class="notes">
						Even if you can't remember your 3 main points, you can put them on a notecard (or your screen).
						Even if you literally read your speech, you will still get practice:
						<ul>
							<li>Organizing your thoughts</li>
							<li>Using your voice</li>
							<li>Using gestures</li>
						</ul>
						Even the president uses a teleprompter sometimes.

							<li>For some of you, the next step is joining Toastmasters</li>
							<li>For others, it's scheduling your next speech.</li>
							<li>Wherever you're at:</li>

						<h3>Take the next step in your Toastmasters journey today. No matter how big or how small it has to be.</h3>
						<h3>Because what you have to say is important. And we're here to help you say it.</h3>
