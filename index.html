								<li>If you're here today it's because you know you have something to say.</li>
								<li>Well you're in the right place because we'd all like to help you say it.</li>
								<li>But sometimes things get in the way.</li>
								<li>Today I want to talk about an obstacle I hear about a lot: time.</li>
								<li>Everyone's so busy. Too busy to work on Toastmasters, they say.</li>
								<li>So today I want to share some tips that I use to get my speeches done when I'm really busy.</li>

						<img alt="A lot of people at TED expressed shock that I'd been able to give a TED talk on less than 4 days' notice.  It's actually worse; due to prior commitments and schedule mishaps, I only wrote my talk the day before. Which I trusted myself to do, and to commit to TED to doing, because I knew this Secret of Writing:  &quot;There is no such thing as writer's block, only holding yourself to too high a standard.&quot; I knew I could definitely write six minutes of text, even if it might not be as good as I wanted.  When time got short, I lowered my ambitions and kept going. But man, I would not have wanted to try that fifteen years earlier." src="images/yudkowsky_tweet.png"/>

							<ul>
								<li>I'm not telling you not to do your best</li>
								<li>You get out what you put in to TM</li>
								<li>if you can't put in as much time as you'd like, don't let that paralyze you.</li>
								<li>You will always learn more from doing something rather than nothing.</li>

						<h2>Use notes if you have to</h2>
						<aside class="notes">
							<p>Yes, no notes is a skill worth having.</p>
							<p>But if you don't have time to work on that skill, you will still get practice:</p>
							<ul>
								<li>Organizing your thoughts</li>
								<li>Using your voice for emphasis</li>
								<li>Using gestures</li>
							</ul>
							<p>If the President can use a teleprompter, you can use notes.</p>

						<h2>You will never <em>not</em> be busy</h2>
						<aside class="notes">
							<ul>
								<li>It's so easy to keep telling yourself what you'll accomplish "when things settle down"</li>
								<li>"After I graduate" "After we settle in to the new house" "After the baby sleeps through the night" "When I'm not driving my kids to activities all the time" "When work isn't so hectic" "When I retire"</li>
								<li>If you're going to be busy anyway, then get busy improving your ability to communicate effectively.</li>
								<li>I think you'll find that it's easier to get other things done when you feel more at ease talking to co-workers, friends, or even your kids.</li>

					<h2>What's <em>your</em> next step?</h2>
					<aside class="notes">
						<ul>
							<li>For some of you, the next step is joining Toastmasters</li>
							<li>For others, it's scheduling your next speech.</li>
							<li>Wherever you're at:</li>
						</ul>
						<p>Take the next step in your Toastmasters journey. No matter how big or how small it has to be.</p>
