# Free Software

## Speaker introduction

- Gratis vs. Libre

## Introduction

Ask your government whether the program that controls radar guns should be a secret inaccessible to public scrutiny.

Ask your car manufacturer whether the software the controls your breaks should be a secret inaccessible to security researchers.

Ask your doctor whether the programs that control your pacemaker should be secret inaccessible to medical researchers.


Software controls more and more of our lives, but who controls that software? Have you ever downloaded an app and wondered what it might be doing behind your back? Have you ever had a favorite application suddenly exhibit a bug that goes completely ignored by the developer? These are the problems that Free Software is meant to prevent.

I'm going to be explaining the definition of Free Software given by the Free Software Foundation. Along the way I'm going to point out the ways that Free Software can make a difference to you, and then I'll close with some ideas for how you can account for this when you make decisions about what software to use.

## 0. Freedom to use the program as you wish

Windows Home can't host a web site.

Occulus Rift SDK can't be used with competing products.

## 1. Freedom to learn how the program works, and change it to make it do what you wish.

Two parts:

- Learn how it works
	- Audi and Volkswagon both cheated on emissions tests.
- Change it to make it do what you wish
	- HP printers were upgraded to reject 3rd party cartridges that were previously accepted.

## 2. Freedom to share copies to help your neighbor AND 3. Freedom to share your changed version.

You might be thinking this is all sunshine and rainbows if you're a programmer, but what about computer users who can't code? This is where the third and fourth freedoms come in.

- LG and Sonos broke devices if people didn't agree to accept a new privacy policy.
- Playstation 3 removes functionality (they were sued, and paid a class action)

In both cases, people bought products based on one set of features, and then those features were diminished or changed in ways that don't benefit the user. If the software in these machines were Free, then anyone could independently maintain those features on behalf of the users that want them.

## Conclusion

The Free Software Foundation would argue that these four freedoms are an ethical imperitive, and that non-free software is immoral full stop. I'm not here to tell you to take that kind of hard line stance. I'm here to raise your awareness of Free Software so that you can include freedom as a consideration when you choose what software to use in your daily life.

When you are deciding what software to use in your home or business, ask yourself whether you want to blindly trust that the developer will always have your best interest at heart. Ask yourself what you would do if the company disappeared.

On Android, use F-Droid

Use alternativeto.net

Ultimately this is about ensuring that users have ultimate control over how their computers operate.

Computers control our lives. Software controls our computers. Who do you want to control that software?
