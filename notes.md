# Adding strength training to my fitness routine

## Introduction 

I love running. Except that it makes my shins hurt, or my knee, or my hip, or my achilles tendon. I tried shoes, form drills, physical therapy. I could take a break for a year and start half as slowly as most beginner programs recommend, and nothing seems to allow me to run for more than a few months without injury. After nearly a decade of on again off again running, I finally decided that if I can't get faster, I'll get stronger instead, and maybe that will help prevent injuries. I decided to start barbell training, and today I'm here to tell you how I did that, why it's been a great decision that you might also want to consider.

## How I started

I have limited time, and I actually want to get stronger.

- Compound lifts: squat, deadlift, bench, press                 # Pictures/gifs of not-muscular-men performing movements
	- 3 sets of 5 reps, 3 days a week
- "training" not "exercising"                                   # Simplified beginner program
	- Increase by 2.5 lbs for arms, and 5 lbs for legs
	- Obviously doesn't work forever, but got me a *long* way.

## Benefits of strength training

- Low injury rate per 100 hours     # Table of injury rates
	- Track and field = 0.57
	- Weight training = 0.0012
- I'm getting stronger               # Pic/gif of 405 deadlift
- (Optional--cut if no time) I get to eat like it's my job. I lose weight if I only eat 2000 calories.
- More useful: packing, kids, moving

## Conclusion

If you like running, and it loves you back, keep running. If you don't, or if you want to round out your fitness program, consider strength training.

1. Learn the main barbell lifts.
1. Do 3 sets of 5.
1. Increase the weight every time you go in.

It's safer, and more useful, and you'll feel stronger in no time.

For me, it was the best fitness decision I ever made.
